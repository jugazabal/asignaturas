GUIDELINES FOR WRITING YOUR RESEARCH PAPER
Your APA paper should include five major sections: the Title Page, Abstract, Main
Paper, Paper Format and References And Citations. See the timeline handout for
important due dates.
1. TITLE PAGE
• Your paper should begin with a title page that follows APA format. The info
at: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/ is great for APA
citation.
• Your title should be interesting and inform the reader of your topic.
2. ABSTRACT
• An abstract page should include the page header. On the first line of the
abstract page, center the word “Abstract” (no bold, formatting, italics,
underlining, or quotation marks).
• Beginning with the next line, write a concise summary of the key points of
your research. (Do not indent.) An abstract should summarize your
research topic, research questions, participants, methods, results, data
analysis, and conclusions.
• Your abstract should be a single paragraph double-spaced. Your abstract
should be between 150 and 250 words.
3. MAIN PAPER (will have four distinct parts):
I. INTRODUCTION
• In general, all papers should begin with an introduction that includes a
thesis statement (see handout on a good/bad thesis).
• The purpose of the introduction is the same as any research paper: in one
to two paragraphs, briefly introduce and state the issue to be examined.
• The introduction always states what you are trying to prove/disprove in
the paper.
II. THESIS STATEMENT
• The most important part of your introduction is this statement.
• The thesis statement is the direction of your paper.
• Your thesis must always be underlined in everything you turn in.
III. BODY
• Each body paragraph should include a topic sentence.
• Your topic sentences must always be underlined in everything you turn in.
• I repeat: Underline each topic sentence of each paragraph.
• Paragraphs have no less than four but no more than six sentences.
• Topic sentences explain/summarize what will be addressed in the
paragraph.
• These topic sentences also act as transitions to create a coherent
argument.
• Transitions link paragraphs together and unite the overall position of your
argument.
• Paragraphs support the particular thesis statement with
evidence/examples.
• The body of your paper should clearly show that your
argument/critique/analysis is moving in a certain direction (the direction
outlined in your introduction).
IV. CONCLUSION
• Bring cohesion to your paper by clearly reiterating your main points.
• Summarize your themes and sub-points.
• Explain what was suggested in the body of your paper.
• Tie up your argument and drive home your thesis statement.
• You should attempt to show that your thesis has been proven.
4. PAPER FORMAT
• Paper length: Micro honors and Econ 230 honors 9-11 pages (not including
title and reference pages)
• 12 point font with 1 inch margins
• Double-spaced
• Headings (where appropriate)
• Your paper’s turnitin.com originality score of no less than 15% and no
more than 25%
• Uses a single source no more than five times.
• Your paper is due May 13th
• Your thesis always underlined.
• Your topic sentences always underlined.
5. REFERENCES AND CITATIONS
Main resource materials:
• Primary source documents e.g., books such as The Wealth of Nations and
JSTOR scholarly articles--no less than three must come from the 30
economic journals athttp://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/whorrace/journals.htm
and my handout on them.
Ancillary resource materials:
• Cited think tanks (e.g. Cato.org, Brookings Institute)
• Popular writings (e.g. NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Economist, other
media).
• No more than three (and they should not be the focal point of your paper’s
evidence).
• wiki’s and blogs are not acceptable sources.
• How many sources should you have? No less than seven and no more than
eleven.
• Note: you may only use two of the in-class readings as direct sources.
I strongly suggest that any single source not be overly relied on.
In-Text Citations (APA Format)
• Rather than footnotes or endnotes, APA Format uses in-text citations.
• Avoid plagiarizing through the use of in-text citations that identify ideas,
information or words from a particular source. APA still requires a
bibliography!

TIPS
• This is a social science paper not an opinion piece. As a general rule you
should avoid writing in first or second person subject or possessive
(singular or plural). Instead write in the third person.
• For example, use “it” not “I” or “we or you”;
• For example, “The evidence” suggests Barack Obama is the greatest
president ever verses “I think” Barack Obama is …or “We believe” Barack
Obama is….)
• Think critically.
• Always outline before you begin
• Analyze the readings and stay organized
• Is your thesis always underlined in everything you turned in?
• Are your topic sentences always underlined?
• Do not use contractions (cannot = ; can’t = )
• Suggest other areas of research
• Start early, use Turnitin.com for my feedback
• Proofread for clarity, punctuation and spelling
• Do not end sentences with a preposition
• Avoid colloquial language and clichés!
• Is your Turnitin originality score of no less than 15% and no more than
25%
• Did your paper overly rely on a one or two source documents?
• Your paper’s word count (proportions) should breakdown, roughly along
the following lines: Intro and Thesis 20%; Body 70%; Conclusion 10%
